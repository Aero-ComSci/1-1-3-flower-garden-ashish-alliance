# 1.1.3FlowerGarden

Flower activity 
AI challenge -

Your Program must do the following:
1. Take user input and generate a drawing of specific flowers and their quantity using turtle.

How???
Use 1.1.3 for guidance

-- Tokenize user input

Compare each of the tokens against a list with 5 flowers your program can draw

Compare each of the tokens to see if it has a quantity

Your program can deny and give the user some guidance.

  [Tokenize user input ](https://www.google.com)

  Obtain quantity is num
  Obtain shape -- if in dictionary common shapes
  Based on flower detected by user input in dict create flower

Create a class flower
Init takes num petals, num flowers, type of flower
Creates a flower(s)

Fun for different draw methods

In this code, we had funcitions that for the 5 flowers that our computer could use. So, the user was able to input their sentecne with whatever they wanted and so we split each of the words into numbers and used if conditions and while loops to determine the number and flowers. So, we made in a way that allowed our code to ask the question again if the user doesn't give a valid input or a high number which we defaulted to 30. Then, using the user input we run the functions and we're able to run it multiple times depending on the user input for number of flowers they want and so we draw the number of flowers of their choice from roses, tulips, lillies, violets, and sunflowers.


Overall, this was a fun project and this brought us closer together in working wise and friendship wise. We leanred each others strengths and weakness and we enjoy working together. So, some difficulties on this were trying to get the flower whole and the stem placement which was probably the hardest part of the code as we were trying to figure out the placement for days till our savior Arnav Kakani fell out of the sky and saved day. The easiest part was drawing the actual flower and stems into functions for us to use along with the gen ai which wasn't that hard along with the user inputs and the "100%" code which you asked for was very simple and we were able to complete that in a span of 15 minutes. Thank you for reading!
